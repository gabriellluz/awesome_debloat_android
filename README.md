  While we have some great alternatives and/or opensource apps above, allowing us to have a completely "Google-free" Android phone, most apps that rely on Google Apps infrastruture might not work such as Uber, Facebook, Runtastic etc. Below we have a list of apps that are NOT opensource but are known to work using a Google-free phone (i.e. using NanoDroid, /e/ OS etc). That means they don't require Google Play Services or can be used with microG only.
  
  FaceApp
  MagiskManager
  Popcorn Time
  Sleep as Android
  Stellio MediaPlayer
  YouTube Vanced (needs microG)
  WhatsApp (needs microG)
