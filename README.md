  Welcome to my list for replacing Google/Amazon apps on your Android Phone.
  
  **Remember: your data is YOUR data. Always.**
  
  This list provides you with good alternatives but it also gives you a list of great open source apps, not only alternatives.

  **Ridesharing apps**

Note: this list of ridesharing apps is NOT free. I just present you with an alternative way to use those apps in a ungoogled phone.

  | App            | Alternative                                                       |
  | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Uber           | Access **m.uber.com** using Bromite. Create a desktop shortcut.   |
  *Using Uber on Bromite will not track your system like Uber official app can do if they want to.
  
  Plex Media/Emby
  Jellyfin client app (needs Jellyfin server, which is also free and opensource, no paid version available :))

  While we have some great alternatives and/or opensource apps above, allowing us to have a completely "Google-free" Android phone, most apps that rely on Google Apps infrastruture might not work such as Uber, Facebook, Runtastic etc. Below we have a list of apps that are NOT opensource but are known to work using a Google-free phone (i.e. using NanoDroid, /e/ OS etc)
