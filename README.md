  While we have some great alternatives and/or opensource apps above, allowing us to have a completely "Google-free" Android phone, most apps that rely on Google Apps infrastruture might not work such as Uber, Facebook, Runtastic etc. Below we have a list of apps that are NOT opensource but are known to work using a Google-free phone (i.e. using NanoDroid, /e/ OS etc)
